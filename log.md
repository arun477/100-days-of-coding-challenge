# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 2, 2017


**Today's Progress**: This is my fisrtday in 100 Days of coding, today i tried to solve problems from freecodecamp, i solved four challenges there, i learned something on manipulating string and arrays, it includes .substring, .substr, .slice, .repeat, .include, .indexOf and i understand how to use Math.max.apply(arg1, array) method to find max num in array and i used map function to manipulate elements in the array

**Thoughts:** today i was really excited because this is my first day of coding challenge, i could solve the problems without any frustruation, i had to search lot in google but finally i got what i wanted. today gone well, i hope tommorow i have the same excitement.

### Day 2: June 3, 2017


**Today's Progress**: today i learned how to generate prime numbers and turncate the string using slice method.

**Thoughts:** today i was trying to solve problem from projecteuler.com, the problem looks easy but i couldn't solve today but i almost reached the result only one step is required to finish the problem i hope tommorow i finish this, and i also solved one problem from freecodecamp it was so easy not took much time.

### Day 3: June 4, 2017


**Today's Progress**: today i was introduced to new frontend frame work materialize, that was really cool. i had revisions on the important array methods by solving problem from freecodecamp, totally i got good revision over array methods.

**Thoughts:** i could see the progress in my solving simple algorithm problems, the time takes for solving the problem reduced notablly. the good news is yesterday's primefactor problem solved, today i solved more problems, overall today was nice day.

### Day 4: June 5, 2017


**Today's Progress**: i learned how to approach the problem and what mindset is reqired to handle the problem. Today i solved interesting problems from freecodecamp and projecteuler, today i learned the importance of considering memory and processing time during coding, one of my today programme took 8 minute to produce the output.

**Thoughts:** today was so good, if i look back problems i solved today that was unbelivable those problems are solved by me.
Today i understand one thing, what needs to solve any problem is two things, one is hope you can solve this and two perseverance.

### Day 5: June 6, 2017


**Today's Progress**: today was not that much good, i coded one or two problems both were super easy, but i learned little basic about regular expressions and string replace method. 

**Thoughts:** not good because i'm not in good mood, but i hope tommorow will be good.

### Day 6: June 7, 2017


**Today's Progress**: i solved the numerical to roman convertor, this convertor convert all natural number upto 4000, it was so cool to work with this problem, due to this problem i understood the power functional programming because i did this code using three four seperate function and now i could understand the object prototype because that has been confusing little while,  .

**Thoughts:** nice day, at the begnning was little rough but latter was good.
