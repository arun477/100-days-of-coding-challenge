# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 2, 2017


**Today's Progress**: This is my fisrtday in 100 Days of coding, today i tried to solve problems from freecodecamp, i solved four challenges there, i learned something on manipulating string and arrays, it includes .substring, .substr, .slice, .repeat, .include, .indexOf and i understand how to use Math.max.apply(arg1, array) method to find max num in array and i used map function to manipulate elements in the array

**Thoughts:** today i was really excited because this is my first day of coding challenge, i could solve the problems without any frustruation, i had to search lot in google but finally i got what i wanted. today gone well, i hope tommorow i have the same excitement.

### Day 2: June 3, 2017


**Today's Progress**: today i learned how to generate prime numbers and turncate the string using slice method.

**Thoughts:** today i was trying to solve problem from projecteuler.com, the problem looks easy but i couldn't solve today but i almost reached the result only one step is required to finish the problem i hope tommorow i finish this, and i also solved one problem from freecodecamp it was so easy not took much time.

### Day 3: June 4, 2017


**Today's Progress**: today i was introduced to new frontend frame work materialize, that was really cool. i had revisions on the important array methods by solving problem from freecodecamp, totally i got good revision over array methods.

**Thoughts:** i could see the progress in my solving simple algorithm problems, the time takes for solving the problem reduced notablly. the good news is yesterday's primefactor problem solved, today i solved more problems, overall today was nice day.

### Day 4: June 5, 2017


**Today's Progress**: i learned how to approach the problem and what mindset is reqired to handle the problem. Today i solved interesting problems from freecodecamp and projecteuler, today i learned the importance of considering memory and processing time during coding, one of my today programme took 8 minute to produce the output.

**Thoughts:** today was so good, if i look back problems i solved today that was unbelivable those problems are solved by me.
Today i understand one thing, what needs to solve any problem is two things, one is hope you can solve this and two perseverance.

### Day 5: June 6, 2017


**Today's Progress**: today was not that much good, i coded one or two problems both were super easy, but i learned little basic about regular expressions and string replace method. 

**Thoughts:** not good because i'm not in good mood, but i hope tommorow will be good.

### Day 6: June 7, 2017


**Today's Progress**: i solved the numerical to roman convertor, this convertor convert all natural number upto 4000, it was so cool to work with this problem, due to this problem i understood the power functional programming because i did this code using three four seperate function and now i could understand the object prototype because that has been confusing little while.

**Thoughts:** nice day, at the begnning was little rough but latter was good.

### Day 7: June 8, 2017


**Today's Progress**: i just practiced regular expression and i found one interesting thing about for loop iteration and array index, to access the element from array we use index, the usual way to access is like array[index], this index can be number or number in string format, means array[1] and array["1"] both are same.

**Thoughts:** today was so good, because i made a cool roman number calculator and published using github page and it works awesome.

### Day 11 ot Day 14: June 12 to june 16, 2017


**Today's Progress**: i feel terible because i could'nt update my progress for past four days because i'm lazy, i felt terible for my inconsistent. but good things i coded all four days, i learned quiet lot  and i built my weather api project it came very well and now i'm working on my portfolio page and it taking time.

**Thoughts:** past four day's was nice because i made my first api powered website, i could'nt upload my progress that is only regret, i could'nt remember all the code i worked, overall it's been a mixed felling, i don't want to do the same mistake again, i'm going to upload my daily progress what ever it takes.

### Day 15: June 17 , 2017


**Today's Progress** i don't know, today was terrible day for me, i kind of messed state, i',m little bit confused today and my thinking about the future intimidating me, i was trying to off focus from that but i couldn't. my procastination punishing me, now i can understand that verywell. but code wise i almost solved three freecodecamp problem and understood the two function method apply and call, and i introduced to memoization concept but i couldn't use this technique today but i hope soon i will use this,

**Thoughts:** not that good but i hope tommorow will be better than this.

### Day 16: June 18 , 2017


**Today's Progress** today i coded but i couldn't solve the problem because my code takes too much time to give result big number so i was trying to optimize my code to speed up the process but couldn't finish that today but i taught me the importance of the efficiency of the code and i hope i solve this tommorow.

**Thoughts:** today i learned some indepth concept of javascript from the video called wierd parts of javascript and it explained the basic mechanism behind the javascript and introduced me to some technical used in javascripts, overall i grasped something.

### Day 17: June 19 , 2017


**Today's Progress** today i did code for my portfolio and i didn't  solve any code problem.

**Thoughts:** i feel little reliefed because i finished my portfolio project but the sad part is i couldn't do what i thought to do.

### Day 17: June 20 , 2017


**Today's Progress** I learned what is immutable datastructure or persistence datastructure is and good news i solved the problem which confusing for while in project euler problem number 9 has been solved but actually i didn't solved my self but i used the stackoverflow for this, so embarassing anyway, it solved so i'm happy now. i started learning jquery library, that's really cooool to learn.

**Thoughts:** i didn't learn much but i finished one code that disturbing me for a while but i solved by saw the solution in online, if i thinke in slightly different way i could solved that problem myself that is not that much hard to solve but i learned how to approach the problems now, and i have one problem left to finish intermidiate algorithm scripting in freecodecamp but the problem is in the format of multidimensional array that looks intimidating but tommorow my full focus will be to solve the problem efficiently.

### Day 18: June 21 , 2017


**Today's Progress** today is Ahaaa moment because i solved the streamroller problem in freecodecamp that made me crazy for a while, now that completed, what i learned from this problem is that multidimenstional array is quiet difficult to handle. more than i learned some of the property of interesting properties fo the function.

**Thoughts:** i'm happy because i solved that problem and moreover good but i have to increase my tutorial time little bit from tommorow onwords. tommorow i'm going to start new project wikipedia viewer. i'm planning to make it cool and better than my previous projects. and i have alot time  for my tutorial and coding and project seperately.

### Day 19: June 22 , 2017


**Today's Progress** i learned quite more than yesterday because i studied in day time, so i decided follow this timing tommorow too, and i solve one coding problem that is dead simple. now entered into advanced algorithm scripting in freecodecamp and it's look so easy than intermediate algoritm scripting anyway i solved only one problem now.

**Thoughts:** today i had lot time for my studies and i feel better and i alloted the timing what i yesterday planned. it worked very well and i learned some basics of sets in mathematics and also i started working on my next project wikipedia viewer, and so far so good.

### Day 20: June 23 , 2017


**Today's Progress** today was a just a revision of what i learned before like event loop and ajax and object reference,
and i solved one code problem today from freecodecamp advanced algorithm, yesterday the same question seems different, today that question looks difference and i solved that and it took almost one and half hours approximately.
**Thoughts:** today i could have missed the code but somehow managed to coded, today was not great day but not too bad day as well.

 ### Day 21: June 24 , 2017


**Today's Progress** today code was really easy one but i tooks me almost 2hours to solve but i enventually i solved it, in the i had to handle array and little bit mathematics, and now revised the difference between call, apply and bind methods.
**Thoughts:** my code was really really worst, i have to focus on optimizing my code and i learned the importance of the algorithm and i have to start learn some basic algorithms. today was good.

 ### Day 22: June 25 , 2017


**Today's Progress** worst totally worst, because i didn't do any coding execpt do some silly exercise in jquery but i feel that is also coding. i know this so stupid to say that is code but what else i do.
**Thoughts:**little embarsing but that's happen sometimes, we have to accept that and move forward

### Day 23: June 26 , 2017


**Today's Progress** totay i worked on single code problem from freecodecamp and that was so easy and i learned something about prototype inheritence, constructor function, pollyfill and also i started to work on my new project using facebook api and i think that will be awesome and i planning to improve my user experience in this project.
**Thoughts:** little satisfaction but not enough and have to work hard than today, yes now i understood every will not be the same and we have to put effort to work when we have bad days.
